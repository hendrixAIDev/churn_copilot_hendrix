**For:** JJ  
**Project:** Take over and enhance ChurnPilot credit card churning app  
**Timeline:** 3-4 weeks  
**Budget Used:** $50-300 (of $1,000 available)  

---

## What You Get

✅ **Week 1:** Working app deployed and accessible from your desktop

## Your Time Commitment

**3 approval gates (total ~1 hour):**

   - I'll present research on what churners struggle with
   - You pick your top 3-5 pain points to solve

3. **Day 19 (20 min):** Approve UI mockups
   - Review new design (dark mode? card-style dashboard?)
   - Confirm feature implementations

**Plus 1-2 hours testing** (spread across week 3)

Based on research into what churners struggle with:

## Risks & How I'll Handle Them

**"What if API costs explode?"**
- Using cheapest Claude model (Haiku: 50x cheaper than Opus)
- Setting up billing alerts at $10, $20, $30
- Rate limiting: max 100 extractions/month
- **Worst case:** $5-10/month (still way under budget)

**"What if the free hosting limits out?"**
- Monitoring usage from day 1
- Streamlit free tier is very generous (won't hit limits for years)
- Plan B: Heroku free tier

**"What if you build the wrong thing?"**
- That's why we have 3 approval gates!
- You're in control of priorities
- We can pivot at any gate

## Questions for You

1. **Current workflow:** How many credit cards do you actively manage?
2. **Device usage:** Primarily one desktop, or need phone + desktop access?
3. **Top pain point:** What frustrates you MOST about tracking cards now?
4. **Time constraints:** Any deadlines I should know about?
5. **Partner mode:** Do you churn with a spouse/partner (P2)?

---

## Next Step

**If you approve:** I'll start immediately
- Day 1: Fork repo, set up dev environment, start research
- Day 3: Present deployment options for your decision
- Day 5: Working app in your hands

**If you want changes:** Tell me what to adjust and I'll revise the plan

**Questions?** Ask me anything!

---

**Bottom Line:** In 3-4 weeks, you'll have a beautiful, working app that solves your actual churning pain points, for less than the cost of CardPointers ($70/year) or MaxRewards ($50/year). And it'll be *yours*, customizable however you want.
